# The-circuit-for-a-battery-level-indicator
Battery level indicator is a circuit that is used to check the battery life. We can easily recognize the battery level with the help of LEDâ€™s. It uses a LM3914 driver IC use to drive 10 LEDs by passing through it sufficient amount of current. 
Brightness of LEDs is controlled by reference
adjustable pin and reference out pin. A variable resistor is also deployed in the circuit to have
variable input voltage at pin 5 of the driver IC. Since the driver IC has two modes of operation
which is bar graph mode and dot mode, it enables us to have indication of the battery life either
in bar form or in dot form. We can have colored lods to indicate state of the batteries like first
three LEDs will indicate low battery. Green LEDs will indicate full battery.
